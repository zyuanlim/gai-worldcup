This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenues from Discord paying subscribers\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, compared to such revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. There was no material\ndifference in the Company’s subscription pricing structure between these periods.  \n*Operating Expenses*.\nOur total operating expenses increased 427% to approximately $5.2 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 from approximately\n$1.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising, marketing, payroll\nand other administrative expenses associated with the Company’s February 2023 initial public offering and administrative cost of\npublic filings of approximately $1.7 million and an increase in management compensation costs of approximately $2.5 million for the fiscal\nyear ended December 31, 2023 compared to such costs for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.  \n*Loss From Operations*.\nOur loss from operations increased 664% to approximately $5.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 from approximately $0.6\nmillion for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising, marketing, payroll\nand other administrative expenses associated with the Company’s February 2023 initial public offering and administrative cost of\npublic filings of approximately $1.7 million and an increase in management compensation costs of approximately $2.5 million for the fiscal\nyear ended December 31, 2023 compared to such costs for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.  \n*Net Loss*.\nOur net loss increased 664% to approximately $5.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 from approximately $0.6 million\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.

Our cost of revenues was $12,757,365 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $15,203,140 for the same period in 2022. Cost of revenues refers to the cost of material and labor cost. The percentage of direct material was over 90% of the total cost of revenues. The decrease of cost of revenues compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the corresponding decrease in revenues. We paid tariffs of $210,962 for the year ended December 31, 2023, and $628,526 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in tariff was mainly due to decrease in revenue in 2023.  Gross profit and gross margin. Our gross profit was $1,214,364 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with a gross profit of $5,754,832 for the same period in 2022. Gross margin decreased from 27% during 2022 to 9% during 2023 due to lower productivity caused by lower revenue.  Selling expenses. As shown below, our selling expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits to our selling department and other expenses incurred in connection with general operations. Our selling expenses increased by $108,939 to $ 1,158,467 for year ended December 31, 2023, from $1,049,529 for the year ended December 31, 2022 mainly due to decrease in freight expense. The decrease in freight by $ 58,923 compared to 2022 was due to lower volume of sales during 2023. Salaries and social insurance increased by $26,592 compared to 2022.  \n|  |  | Year ended | | | | | |  |  | Year ended | | | | | |  |  |  | | | | | |  |\n\n|  |  |  | |  |  |  | |  |  |  | |  |  |  | |  |\n| As of and during the nine months ended February 28, 2023 |  |  | |  |  |  | |  |  |  | |  |  |  | |  |\n| Product revenues to external customers |  | $ | 356,856 |  |  | $ | 143,941 |  |  | $ | — |  |  | $ | 500,797 |  |\n| Service revenues to external customers |  |  | 20,672 |  |  |  | 59,168 |  |  |  | — |  |  |  | 79,840 |  |\n| Total revenues to external customers |  |  | 377,528 |  |  |  | 203,109 |  |  |  | - |  |  |  | 580,637 |  |\n| Operating income (loss) |  |  | 41,053 |  |  |  | 35,439 |  |  |  | (62,402 | ) |  |  | 14,090 |  |  \n(1)Includes the elimination of intersegment transactions.

Compensatory Arrangements of Certain OfficersOn April 16, 2024, the Leadership Development, Inclusion and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Alphabet approved the accrual of dividend equivalent units to holders of all unvested stock units, subject to the approval of a dividend declaration by the Board of Directors of the Company (which was approved and announced on April 25, 2024). This approval covers both performance stock unit awards and Google stock unit awards, and applies both to currently outstanding and future equity awards. For the avoidance of doubt, the corresponding amendments to the respective stock unit grant agreements will apply both to currently outstanding grant agreements and all future grant agreements. As stock units are not outstanding shares of stock and thus would not otherwise be entitled to participate in any dividends (including the one referenced above), the crediting of dividend equivalent units is intended to preserve the equity-based incentives intended by the Company when the stock units were granted and to treat the holders of stock units consistently with all stockholders.\n44  \n---  \nITEM 6.EXHIBITS  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ExhibitNumber | | |  | | |  | | | Description | | |  | | | Incorporated by reference herein | | | | | | | | |\n\nWe face intense and growing competition for our products and services, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive positions.  \nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, industry standards, and frequent new platform and application introductions and improvements. We anticipate continued competitive challenges from current competitors who address different aspects of our offerings, and in many cases, many of these competitors are more established and enjoy greater resources than we do. We also expect competitive challenges from new entrants into the industry or existing large companies seeking to grow their current offerings. If we are unable to anticipate or effectively react to these competitive challenges, our competitive position could weaken, and we could experience a decline in our growth rate and revenue that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  \nOur main sources of current and potential competition fall into several categories:  \n|  | • |  | AI companies focused on solutions in the conversational interface, language understanding and processing; |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |  \n|  | • |  | organizations offering products within our current target verticals; and |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |  \n|  | • |  | legacy providers, including large technology providers seeking to add or scale AI capabilities. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |  \nWe caution that many of our competitors may possess advantages such as higher brand visibility, lengthier operational track records, more developed and broader customer bases, larger sales and marketing budgets and teams, superior technological capabilities, a broader network of channel and distribution partners, broader geographical reach, concentrated expertise in specific vertical markets, reduced labor and research and development expenditures, more substantial and mature intellectual property portfolios, as well as significantly greater financial, technical, and overall resources for offering support, pursuing acquisitions, and innovating new products.  \nPotential customers may also prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than a new supplier regardless of platform or application performance or features.

The ERP system went live at Sunset West in December 2022 and in the legacy Hooker divisions and for consolidated reporting in early September 2023. We expect the ERP system to go live in the Home Meridian segment during fiscal 2026. Although we currently expect the ERP implementation to increase efficiencies by leveraging a common, cloud-based system throughout all divisions and standardizing processes and reporting, our ERP system implementation may not result in improvements that outweigh its costs and may disrupt our operations. Our inability to mitigate existing and future disruptions could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity. When the ERP system went live at Sunset West and legacy Hooker divisions, the conversion process significantly impacted shipping activities and negatively impacted sales and profitability in the respective periods, due to longer than expected post-implementation stabilization. The ERP system implementation subjects us to substantial costs and inherent risks associated with migrating from our legacy systems. These costs and risks could include, but are not limited to:  \n|  | ● | Significant capital and operating expenditures; |\n| --- | --- | --- |  \n|  | ● | Disruptions to our domestic and international supply chains; |\n| --- | --- | --- |  \n|  | ● | Inability to fill customer orders accurately and on a timely basis, or at all; |\n| --- | --- | --- |  \n|  | ● | Inability to process payments to suppliers, vendors and associates accurately and in a timely manner; |\n| --- | --- | --- |  \n|  | ● | Disruption to our system of internal controls; |\n| --- | --- | --- |  \n|  | ● | Inability to fulfill our SEC or other governmental reporting requirements in a timely or accurate manner; |\n| --- | --- | --- |  \n|  | ● | Inability to fulfill international, federal, state or local tax filing requirements in a timely or accurate manner; and |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n|  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2024 | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Limited partnership investments, beginning of period | | | $ | 13,879 |  |  | | | $ | 16,068 |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Capital contributions | | | 118 | |  |  | | | 34 | |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Pro-rata share in the net income (loss) of limited partnerships | | | 877 | |  |  | | | (213) | |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Distributions | | | — | |  |  | | | — | |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Limited partnership investments, end of period | | | $ | 14,874 |  |  | | | $ | 15,889 |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  \nCloud Computing ArrangementsThe Company defers implementation costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements and amortizes these costs over the term of the arrangement. Other InvestmentsThe Company holds investments in education technology start-ups focused on transformational technologies that improve student success. These investments are accounted for at cost less impairment as they do not have readily determinable fair value. Tuition ReceivableNon-current tuition receivable, net, represents tuition that the Company expects to collect, but not within the next 12 months. OtherOther is comprised primarily of deferred financing costs associated with the Company’s credit facility, deferred contract costs related to commissions paid in the Australia/New Zealand segment to third party international recruitment agents, and refundable security deposits associated with the Company’s leased campus and office space.10.    Accounts Payable and Accrued ExpensesAccounts payable and accrued expenses consist of the following as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024 (in thousands):  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |  \n|  | • |  | competition from other companies offering artificial intelligence products that have greater resources, technology, relationships and/or expertise; |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |  \n|  | • |  | our ability to compete effectively in a highly competitive market; |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |  \n|  | • |  | our ability to protect and enhance our corporate reputation and brand; |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |  \n|  | • |  | our ability to hire, retain, train and motivate qualified personnel and senior management and our ability to deploy our personnel and resources to meet customer demand; |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |  \n|  | • |  | our ability to grow through acquisitions and successfully integrate any such acquisitions; |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |  \n|  | • |  | the impact from future regulatory, judicial, and legislative changes in our industry; |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |  \n|  | • |  | increases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of materials, which could harm our business; |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |  \n|  | • |  | our ability to successfully maintain, protect, enforce and grow our intellectual property rights; |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |  \n|  | • |  | our future financial performance ,including the ability of future revenues to meet projected annual bookings; |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |  \n1  \n---  \n#####  \n|  | • |  | our ability to forecast and maintain an adequate rate of revenue growth and appropriately plan our expenses; |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |  \n|  | • |  | our ability to generate sufficient revenue from each of our revenue streams; or |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |  \n|  | • |  | the other risks and uncertainties discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Report. |\n\n•View of Business combines emotion grading and call context to infer how the customer perceives your business: positive, negative, or neutral.\nThese structured data pieces are then paired with natural language explanations of why callers are reacting the way they are, enhancing the understanding of emotional dynamics during conversations. Call Summaries and Sentiment Suite are just the first in a series of AI enhancements in Marchex’s product pipeline, all designed to equip organizations with applications to proactively identify sales and growth opportunities, as well as address issues that may lead to negative experiences and reviews from dissatisfied customers.  \nBusiness Update  \nFor our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, our revenue was $49.9 million, which decreased by $2.3 million, or 5%, compared to $52.2 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease is attributable primarily to lower conversational volumes in 2023 compared to 2022, particularly with our small business listing and solutions resellers. While we do expect to see continued lower call volumes in the near term based on the continuation of certain volume trends from late 2023, we believe that previously won dealer channel and Auto OEM relationships ramping over the course of the year, extension of existing customers to multi-year arrangements, expansion of our go-to-market initiatives resulting in new customer relationships across our verticals, continued innovation in our AI capabilities and product offerings, and completion of the necessary infrastructure to accelerate product cross selling to existing and new customers may provide an opportunity for potential revenue growth.  \nWe believe our operating expenses have prospective opportunity for further efficiencies as we continue to make advancements in our technology infrastructure and cloud initiatives, to \"OneStack\". OneStack enables our technologies and clients to be more easily managed in a less costly operating environment. It provides a streamlined product innovation and go to market approach, allowing our vertical market clients to potentially consume all our signals, data analytics and applied AI and also provides speed and scale for client onboarding while streamlining support and account management.  \nFor additional information on the effects of our technology environment restructuring efforts on our business and operations, refer to “Results of Operations” within this discussion and analysis and Item 1 of Part I, “Business.”  \nFactors Affecting our Performance\n\nNone  \n*For\nthe year ended December 31, 2022*  \nOn\nNovember 30, 2022, the Company issued 21,000 shares of its Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to Bill Edmonds in satisfaction of $21,000\nloans payable to Mr. Edmonds.  \nThe\nnumber of preferred shares authorized with a par value of $0.0001 per share at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was 5,000,000\nand 5,000,000, respectively. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were 52,000 and 52,000 shares of preferred stock issued\nand outstanding, respectively.  \n| **ITEM  6.** | **[RESERVED]** |\n| --- | --- |  \n| **ITEM  7.** | **MANAGEMENT’S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.** |\n| --- | --- |  \nThe\nfollowing discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements\nand the related notes, and other financial information included in this report.  \nOur\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking.\nForward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like:\n“believe”, “expect”, “estimate”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “project”\nand similar expressions, or words that, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking\nstatements, which apply only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain\nrisks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. These risks\nand uncertainties include international, national, and local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage,\nor forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; new product development and introduction; existing government\nregulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant\ncustomers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; change in business strategy or development plans;\nbusiness disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; the risk of foreign currency\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 28 |\n|  |\n|  |  \n***If we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our ability to implement our business strategies could be delayed or hindered.***  \nOur future success will depend, in part, upon the efforts of Meryl Golden, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Barry Goldstein, our Executive Chairman. The loss of Ms. Golden or Mr. Goldstein or other key personnel could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategies and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we continue to grow, we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified management personnel, but we may not be able to do so. Our ability to recruit and retain such personnel will depend upon a number of factors, such as our results of operations and prospects and the level of competition prevailing in the market for qualified personnel. Ms. Golden and we are parties to an employment agreement which expires on December 31, 2024. Mr. Goldstein and we are parties to an employment agreement which expires on the earlier of December 31, 2024 or at the time of our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders if he is not re-elected Chairman of the Board at such time.  \n***Difficult conditions in the economy generally could adversely affect our business and operating results.***  \nAs with most businesses, we believe that difficult conditions in the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. General economic conditions also could adversely affect us in the form of consumer behavior, which may include decreased demand for our products. As consumers become more cost conscious, they may choose to purchase lower levels of insurance.  \n***Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition.***  \nOur financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles, which are periodically revised, interpreted and/or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new guidance or interpretations, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition that is either unexpected or has a greater impact than expected.  \n***Our business could be adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or those of one or more of our vendors.***\u001B[0m\u001B[32;1m\u001B[1;3mAlphabet's management outlook on the future, as derived from their SEC filings, highlights several key areas of focus and concern:\n\n1. **Competitive Landscape**: Alphabet acknowledges the intense and growing competition in the market for its products and services. The company faces challenges from current competitors who address different aspects of its offerings, as well as from new entrants and existing large companies seeking to expand their offerings. Alphabet's main sources of competition include AI companies focused on conversational interfaces, language understanding, and processing; organizations offering products within Alphabet's target verticals; and legacy providers, including large technology providers seeking to add or scale AI capabilities.\n\n2. **Competitive Advantages and Challenges**: The company is aware that many of its competitors may possess advantages such as higher brand visibility, more developed customer bases, larger sales and marketing budgets, superior technological capabilities, and significantly greater financial and technical resources. Alphabet cautions that potential customers may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers, which could impact the company's ability to compete effectively.\n\n3. **Revenue Growth and Financial Performance**: Alphabet's financial performance, including the ability to maintain an adequate rate of revenue growth and plan expenses appropriately, is highlighted as a critical area. The company aims to generate sufficient revenue from each of its revenue streams and is mindful of the risks and uncertainties that could impact its financial condition and results of operations.\n\n4. **Operational and Technological Challenges**: The implementation of Alphabet's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is mentioned as a potential disruptor to business operations. While the ERP system is expected to increase efficiencies, its implementation may not result in improvements that outweigh its costs and could disrupt operations.\n\n5. **Business Update and Outlook**: Despite facing a decrease in revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, Alphabet remains optimistic about potential revenue growth opportunities. The company expects to benefit from dealer channel and Auto OEM relationships, expansion of go-to-market initiatives, innovation in AI capabilities, and the completion of infrastructure to accelerate product cross-selling. Alphabet also sees opportunities for further efficiencies in operating expenses as it advances its technology infrastructure and cloud initiatives.\n\n6. **Key Personnel and Economic Conditions**: The success of Alphabet's business strategies is partly dependent on key personnel, including its President and CEO, Meryl Golden, and Executive Chairman, Barry Goldstein. The company acknowledges that difficult economic conditions could adversely affect its business and operating results.\n\nIn summary, Alphabet's management outlook reflects a cautious yet optimistic stance towards the future.

Below are material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.Risks Specific to our CompanyWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, a loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business. We generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers, companies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, such as our initiatives to phase out third-party cookies (which remain subject to review, affecting the timing), as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Risks Related to Ownership of our Stock We cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program or dividend program will be continuously active or fully consummated', metadata={'name': 'Alphabet Inc.', 'tickers': 'GOOGL, GOOG', 'exchanges': 'Nasdaq', 'form': '10-Q', 'filing_date': '2024-04-26', 'industry': 'Services-Computer Programming, Data Processing, Etc.', 'id': 37356.0})]}"
