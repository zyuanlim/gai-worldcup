Compensatory Arrangements of Certain OfficersOn April 16, 2024, the Leadership Development, Inclusion and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Alphabet approved the accrual of dividend equivalent units to holders of all unvested stock units, subject to the approval of a dividend declaration by the Board of Directors of the Company (which was approved and announced on April 25, 2024). This approval covers both performance stock unit awards and Google stock unit awards, and applies both to currently outstanding and future equity awards. For the avoidance of doubt, the corresponding amendments to the respective stock unit grant agreements will apply both to currently outstanding grant agreements and all future grant agreements. As stock units are not outstanding shares of stock and thus would not otherwise be entitled to participate in any dividends (including the one referenced above), the crediting of dividend equivalent units is intended to preserve the equity-based incentives intended by the Company when the stock units were granted and to treat the holders of stock units consistently with all stockholders.\\n44  \\n---  \\nITEM 6.EXHIBITS  \\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| ExhibitNumber | | |  | | |  | | | Description | | |  | | | Incorporated\\xa0by\\xa0reference\\xa0herein | | | | | | | | |', metadata={'name': 'Alphabet Inc.', 'tickers': 'GOOGL, GOOG', 'exchanges': 'Nasdaq', 'form': '10-Q', 'filing_date': '2024-04-26', 'industry': 'Services-Computer Programming, Data Processing, Etc.', 'id': 37380.0}),\n",

Below are material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.Risks Specific to our CompanyWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, a loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business. We generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers, companies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, such as our initiatives to phase out third-party cookies (which remain subject to review, affecting the timing), as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Risks Related to Ownership of our Stock We cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program or dividend program will be continuously active or fully consummated', metadata={'name': 'Alphabet Inc.', 'tickers': 'GOOGL, GOOG', 'exchanges': 'Nasdaq', 'form': '10-Q', 'filing_date': '2024-04-26', 'industry': 'Services-Computer Programming, Data Processing, Etc.', 'id': 37356.0}),\n",
